# OpenAPI Extensions

This document is the canonical reference for Printing Press-specific OpenAPI
`x-*` extensions. OpenAPI allows extension fields anywhere, but the Printing
Press only reads the extensions listed here.

Source of truth: `internal/openapi/parser.go`. This document should be updated
in the same change as any new `Extensions["x-*"]` lookup in that file.

## `info` Extensions

### `x-api-name`

Overrides the API slug only when `info.title` does not fold to a usable slug.
The parser first applies its normal name cleaning to `info.title`; `x-api-name`
is only consulted when that result is empty or `api`.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Name`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Cleaned with the same slug normalization as `info.title`.
- Ignored when the cleaned value is empty or `api`.
- Ignored when `info.title` already produced a usable slug.

Example:

```yaml
info:
  title: API
  version: "1.0"
  x-api-name: example-service
```

### `x-display-name`

Preserves the human-readable brand name when slug-derived title casing would
deform it.

Parsed field: `APISpec.DisplayName`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Empty or non-string values leave `DisplayName` empty, so downstream code falls
  back to catalog metadata or slug-derived naming.
- The parser does not enforce a length cap for `x-display-name`. The separate
  `registry.json` display-name fallback used by `mcp-sync` rejects registry
  values longer than 40 characters, but that limit does not apply here.

Example:

```yaml
info:
  title: Cal Com
  version: "1.0"
  x-display-name: Cal.com
```

### `x-website`

Provides a product or vendor website URL when standard OpenAPI metadata does
not carry one.

Parsed field: `APISpec.WebsiteURL`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Used only when `info.contact.url` is absent.
- `externalDocs.url` is used after `x-website` if no website URL has been found.
- The parser does not validate the URL shape.

Example:

```yaml
info:
  title: Example Service
  version: "1.0"
  x-website: https://www.example.com
```

### `x-proxy-routes`

Declares route-to-service mapping for the proxy-envelope client pattern.

Parsed field: `APISpec.ProxyRoutes`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a map.
- Map keys are path prefixes.
- Map values must be strings; non-string values are skipped.
- A missing or malformed map leaves `ProxyRoutes` empty.

Example:

```yaml
info:
  title: Example Service
  version: "1.0"
  x-proxy-routes:
    /v1/search: search
    /v1/publish: publishing
```

### `x-origin` / `x-providerName`

Recognized on Google Discovery specs converted by apis.guru. These extensions do
not populate an `APISpec` field; they gate the parser's operationId-based
resource fallback for paths such as `/v2/{name}` and `/{resource}:getIamPolicy`.

Rules:
- Optional.
- `x-providerName: googleapis.com` enables Google Discovery resource fallback.
- `x-origin` enables the fallback when any entry has `format: google` or a
  Discovery URL under `googleapis.com/$discovery`.
- Ignored for non-Google specs.

### `x-tier-routing`

Declares opt-in free/paid credential routing for APIs where some endpoints work
without credentials and other endpoints require a separate paid key or token.

Parsed field: `APISpec.TierRouting`

Rules:
- Optional.
- May be declared at the OpenAPI root or under `info`.
- Requires a `tiers` map when present.
- `default_tier` is optional; endpoints without `x-tier` use global auth when it
  is absent.
- V1 tier auth supports only `none`, `api_key`, and `bearer_token`.
- Credential-bearing tier `base_url` values must be HTTPS and cannot point at
  loopback, private, link-local, or unrelated hosts unless
  `allow_cross_host_auth: true` documents explicit review.
- Incompatible with `client_pattern: proxy-envelope` and with resource- or
  endpoint-level `base_url` overrides when any tier declares its own `base_url`.
- Tier credential env vars are read from the environment at request time; they
  are not serialized into generated config files.

Example:

```yaml
x-tier-routing:
  default_tier: free
  tiers:
    free:
      auth:
        type: none
    paid:
      base_url: https://paid.api.example.com
      auth:
        type: api_key
        in: query
        header: api_key
        env_vars: [EXAMPLE_PAID_KEY]
```

### `x-mcp`

Declares MCP server shape for the generated CLI. Mirrors the internal YAML
spec's top-level `mcp:` block so OpenAPI specs can opt into the same
pre-generation MCP enrichment recipe (notably the code-orchestration pattern
for large surfaces: `transport: [stdio, http]` + `orchestration: code` +
`endpoint_tools: hidden`).

Parsed field: `APISpec.MCP` (`spec.MCPConfig`)

Rules:
- Optional. Specs without `x-mcp` keep today's stdio-only endpoint-mirror
  behavior.
- May be declared at the OpenAPI root or under `info`. Root takes precedence
  when both are present.
- Shape mirrors the internal YAML `mcp:` block field-for-field: `transport`,
  `addr`, `intents`, `endpoint_tools`, `orchestration`,
  `orchestration_threshold`.
- Validated by `validateMCP` at spec load (same allowlist as internal YAML):
  unknown transports and malformed addresses are rejected.

Example:

```yaml
x-mcp:
  transport: [stdio, http]
  orchestration: code
  endpoint_tools: hidden
```

### `x-tenant-env-var`

Declares the env-var name that resolves the implicit `{tenant}` path
placeholder for multi-tenant SaaS APIs whose every path is
`/tenant/{tenant}/<resource>`. Without this annotation, the generator
classifies tenant-templated paths as parent-context-dependent and emits an
empty `defaultSyncResources` / `syncResourcePath` map; sync silently no-ops
and every downstream offline command ships broken.

Parsed fields: `APISpec.EndpointTemplateVars` (`tenant` added) and
`APISpec.EndpointTemplateEnvOverrides["tenant"]` (env-var name).

Rules:
- Optional. Specs without `x-tenant-env-var` keep single-tenant behavior;
  no `{tenant}`-aware emission, no spurious env reads.
- Declared under `info` only (path-positional templates are spec-wide).
- Value must be a non-empty string after `TrimSpace`. Whitespace-only
  values are treated as absent.
- The placeholder name is `tenant`. Specs that use a different
  placeholder (`{workspace}`, `{org}`) should set
  `EndpointTemplateVars` + `EndpointTemplateEnvOverrides` directly in
  internal YAML until this extension generalizes.

Effect on generated output (when set):
- The profiler treats `/.../{tenant}/...` paths as standalone-listable, so
  the resource becomes a flat `SyncableResource` rather than a
  `DependentSyncResource`.
- The emitted `config.go` reads the override env-var name (e.g.
  `ST_TENANT_ID`) into `Config.TemplateVars["tenant"]` at `Load()` time.
- The emitted `url.go` `buildURL` substitutes `{tenant}` from
  `Config.TemplateVars` at request time and names the override env var in
  the actionable error when the value is missing.
- The emitted `sync.go` filters `{tenant}` out of the unresolved-key
  warning so per-tenant paths don't get skipped as "requires parent
  context".

Example:

```yaml
info:
  title: ServiceTitan CRM
  version: 1.0.0
  x-tenant-env-var: ST_TENANT_ID
```

## Security Scheme Extensions

Security scheme extensions are read from
`components.securitySchemes.<scheme-name>`. They can declare composed cookie
auth or override install/config metadata when the API spec's service identity
differs from the product identity exposed by the printed CLI.

When `components.securitySchemes` is absent, the parser may infer simple
bearer auth from clear API-wide prose such as `Authorization: Bearer`,
`personal access token`, `fine-grained PAT`, `app installation token`, or
`OAuth app token`. An explicitly empty block disables that prose fallback:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes: {}
```

### `x-auth-type`

Marks an API key scheme as composed auth.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Type`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be the exact string `composed` to take effect.
- Only read for OpenAPI `apiKey` security schemes.
- Any other value leaves the normal API key mapping in place.

### `x-auth-format`

Template used to assemble the composed auth header or cookie value.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Format`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Only read when `x-auth-type: composed`.
- Must be a string.

### `x-prefix`

Declares a literal token prefix for header API key schemes.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Format`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Only read for OpenAPI `apiKey` security schemes with `in: header`.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- When present, the parser stores `"<prefix> {token}"` in `Auth.Format`.
- Ignored for query API keys and non-API-key auth schemes.

Example:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKey:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      x-prefix: Klaviyo-API-Key
```

### `x-auth-env-vars`

Overrides the generated credential environment variable names.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.EnvVars`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a list of strings. A single string is also accepted for convenience.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed from each item.
- Empty and non-string list items are ignored.
- When at least one non-empty item is present, the list replaces the parser's
  generated env var names.

Catalog-driven equivalent: when a catalog entry declares `auth_env_vars`, the
generator layers the canonical names on top of the parser-derived default at
runtime without editing the upstream spec. The catalog list takes precedence,
the parser default trails as a backwards-compat fallback, and the rebuilt env
var list is emitted as an OR-case (any one satisfies auth). The catalog field
is ignored for HTTP Basic auth (credential-pair shape); declare basic-auth
env var pairs via `x-auth-env-vars` on the security scheme instead. See
[`docs/CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md#auth_env_vars).

### `x-auth-vars`

Overrides the generated credential environment variable metadata.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.EnvVarSpecs`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a list of objects.
- Each object must include `name`, `kind`, `required`, and `sensitive`.
- `name` must be a non-empty string.
- `kind` must be one of `per_call`, `auth_flow_input`, or `harvested`.
- `required` and `sensitive` must be booleans.
- `description` is optional and must be a string when present.
- Group IDs and legacy aliases are not parsed. Express OR relationships in
  `description` text and by marking each alternative `required: false`.
- Use either `x-auth-env-vars` for legacy name-only overrides or `x-auth-vars`
  for rich metadata. If both are present, `x-auth-vars` wins.
- Malformed values are ignored with a warning, and the parser falls back to the
  generated auth env-var defaults.

Example:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    apiKey:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      x-auth-vars:
        - name: TODOIST_API_KEY
          kind: per_call
          required: true
          sensitive: true
          description: Todoist API key.
```

### `x-speakeasy-example`

Uses a Speakeasy security-scheme example as the credential environment variable
name when it is shaped like a shell env var.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.EnvVars`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string shaped like an uppercase environment variable name, for
  example `DUB_API_KEY`.
- Ignored when `x-auth-env-vars` is present.
- Ignored when the selected auth config has multiple env vars.
- Ignored when the value looks like a token value instead of an env var name.

### `x-auth-optional`

Marks the credential as optional for install/config surfaces.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Optional`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a boolean.
- `true` makes MCPB `user_config.required` false even for auth types that
  normally require credentials.

### `x-auth-key-url`

Declares the page where users can get a credential.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.KeyURL`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- The parser does not validate the URL shape.

When the extension is absent and the spec has any auth, the parser falls back
through the following sources in order and uses the first plausible HTTPS URL:

1. The selected security scheme's `description` (extracted via regex).
2. `info.description`, but only when the surrounding text mentions
   credential-related cues (`token`, `api key`, `credential`, `register`,
   `sign up`, etc.) so an unrelated URL doesn't get picked.

`externalDocs.url` and `info.contact.url` are intentionally **not** fallbacks
for `KeyURL`. Those almost always point at the API's docs landing page or the
company homepage, neither of which is where users actually create a token.
When `KeyURL` ends up empty, the printed CLI uses `WebsiteURL` (already
populated from `externalDocs.url`, `info.contact.url`, and `x-website`) under
a separate `See API docs: <URL>` line — honest framing for those URLs.

Catalog YAML's `auth_key_url:` (see [`CATALOG.md`](CATALOG.md)) overrides the
inference. The result drives the printed CLI's `Get a key at: <URL>` output in
auth prompts and `doctor`.

### `x-auth-instructions`

Free-form one-line guidance shown alongside `x-auth-key-url`, e.g. "Settings →
Personal access tokens → Generate new". The printed CLI surfaces this under
the URL in auth prompts, `doctor`, and the `auth setup` command.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Instructions`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Use this when `x-auth-key-url` lands on a docs page rather than the keys UI;
  the URL says where to start, the instruction says what to do once there.

Catalog YAML's `auth_instructions:` overrides any spec-supplied value.

### `x-auth-title`

Overrides the title shown for the credential field in install/config surfaces.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Title`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Used when the selected auth scheme has a single env var. Multiple env vars
  keep env-var-name titles to avoid duplicate field labels.

### `x-auth-description`

Overrides the full description shown for the credential field in install/config
surfaces.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Description`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Used as the complete description when the selected auth scheme has a single
  env var. When omitted, the generator builds a description from env var name,
  display name, optionality, and `x-auth-key-url`.

Example:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    ApiKeyAuth:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: x-apikey
      x-auth-env-vars:
        - FLIGHTAWARE_API_KEY
      x-auth-optional: true
      x-auth-key-url: https://flightaware.com/commercial/aeroapi/
      x-auth-title: FlightAware AeroAPI Key
      x-auth-description: Optional FlightAware AeroAPI credential for enriched flight data.
```

### `x-auth-cookie-domain`

Domain used when extracting named cookies for composed auth.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.CookieDomain`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Only read when `x-auth-type: composed`.
- Must be a string.

### `x-auth-cookies`

Cookie names required to fill the composed auth format.

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.Cookies`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Only read when `x-auth-type: composed`.
- Must be a list.
- List items must be strings; non-string items are skipped.

Example:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    browserSession:
      type: apiKey
      in: header
      name: Authorization
      x-auth-type: composed
      x-auth-format: "Session {session_id}:{csrf_token}"
      x-auth-cookie-domain: app.example.com
      x-auth-cookies:
        - session_id
        - csrf_token
```

### `x-oauth-refresh-token-mechanism`

Declares how the authorization endpoint should be asked to issue a refresh
token. Providers diverge: Google reads `access_type=offline` as a query
parameter, while WHOOP, X/Twitter, and others read a magic scope value
(`offline`, `offline.access`, `offline_access`) instead. The generator emits
neither by default because a Google-shaped silent default silently breaks
other providers (broken refresh path is invisible until access-token TTL
expires).

Parsed field: `APISpec.Auth.RefreshTokenMechanism`

Rules:

- Optional. Only consumed by the authorization_code grant template; ignored
  for other grants and non-OAuth2 auth.
- Must be a string. Leading and trailing whitespace on the whole value is
  trimmed.
- Two exact-match prefixes are accepted:
  - `scope:<value>` appends `<value>` to the scope list. No query param is
    added.
  - `query:<key>=<value>` sets the query parameter exactly once. No scope
    change.
- Malformed values (empty key, empty value, missing `=` for `query`, unknown
  prefix, uppercase prefix) are ignored and produce no emission.
- For `query:<key>=<value>`, the reserved authorization-URL parameter names
  `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, `response_type`, `state`, and `scope` are
  rejected. Permitting them would let a spec author silently overwrite the
  generator's CSRF state token or core OAuth params.
- Note: the single-mechanism shape cannot express Google's two-param recipe
  (`access_type=offline` + `prompt=consent`). The first param is sufficient
  for refresh-token issuance on initial consent; the second forces re-consent
  on subsequent logins to keep the refresh-token contract alive. Specs that
  need both should declare one via this extension and add the other through a
  future multi-mechanism syntax (out of scope here).

Example:

```yaml
components:
  securitySchemes:
    OAuth2:
      type: oauth2
      x-oauth-refresh-token-mechanism: scope:offline
      flows:
        authorizationCode:
          authorizationUrl: https://api.example.com/oauth/authorize
          tokenUrl: https://api.example.com/oauth/token
          scopes:
            read: Read access
```

## Path Item Extensions

Path item extensions are read from a path object, beside its HTTP operations.
They apply to every operation under that path because sync identity and critical
resource status are resource-scoped.

### `x-resource-id`

Declares the response field that should be used as the primary key when sync
stores resources locally.

Parsed field: `Endpoint.IDField`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Leading and trailing whitespace is trimmed.
- Non-string values emit a warning and are ignored.
- An empty or missing value falls through to the parser's response-schema
  fallback chain: `id`, then `name`, then the first required scalar field.
- Applies to every operation on the path item.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /widgets:
    x-resource-id: widget_uid
    get:
      operationId: listWidgets
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
```

### `x-critical`

Marks a syncable resource as essential. Generated sync commands fail the run
when a critical resource fails, while non-critical resource failures can be
reported as warnings unless `--strict` is used.

Parsed field: `Endpoint.Critical`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Defaults to `false`.
- Accepts native booleans.
- Also accepts the strings `"true"` and `"1"` as true, case-insensitive after
  trimming.
- The strings `"false"`, `"0"`, and `""` are false.
- Other string values emit a warning and are false.
- Non-boolean, non-string values emit a warning and are false.
- Applies to every operation on the path item.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /accounts:
    x-critical: true
    get:
      operationId: listAccounts
      responses:
        "200":
          description: OK
```

### `x-tier`

Selects a tier declared by `x-tier-routing` for a path item or one operation.

Parsed field: `Endpoint.Tier`

Rules:
- Optional.
- Must be a string.
- Operation-level `x-tier` overrides path-item-level `x-tier`.
- The value must name a tier in `x-tier-routing.tiers`.
- `security: []` / `security: [{}]` must not be combined with an auth-bearing
  tier. Use a `none` tier for anonymous endpoints.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /public/search:
    x-tier: free
    get:
      responses:
        "200": {description: ok}
  /premium/search:
    get:
      x-tier: paid
      responses:
        "200": {description: ok}
```

### `x-pp-sync-walker`

Declares a hierarchical-walk dependency for a child endpoint. Synthesizes (or
augments) a dependent-resource entry so the generator's existing
parent-child sync machinery handles the fan-out — fetch the parent, extract
the named field from each parent record, substitute it into the child path,
fetch each child.

Use this when the auto-detected parent-child link in the profiler would miss
your endpoint or pick the wrong parent. Common cases:

- The child path's placeholder name does not match a parent resource (e.g.
  `/games/{game_key}/leagues` — `game_key` does not stem to "games" via the
  default `_id`/`_key` stripping).
- The parent placeholder lives in a matrix or query parameter rather than the
  path, so the path has no `{placeholder}` for auto-detection to read.
- The child path uses a parent field that is not the parent's primary key
  (e.g. Yahoo Fantasy's `game_key`, Reddit's `subreddit` name).

Parsed field: `Endpoint.Walker` (a `*spec.WalkerConfig`)

Rules:
- Optional.
- Operation-level only. (No path-item-level form today.)
- `parent` (string, required): the resource name to iterate. The parent must
  itself be a syncable resource (i.e., have a flat-list endpoint). Walkers
  pointing at non-syncable parents emit a `warning:` to stderr at generate
  time and are dropped.
- `key_field` (string, optional): the field to extract from each parent
  record for substitution into the child path. Defaults to the parent's
  primary key. Set this when the child path needs a non-PK field.
- `key_param` (string, optional): the placeholder name in the child path
  that receives the extracted value. Defaults to the first (and only)
  `{placeholder}` in the child path when there is exactly one. **Required
  explicitly when the child path has 0 or 2+ placeholders** — the
  single-placeholder default would otherwise pick the wrong slot (or no
  slot at all). The generator warns and drops the walker when it's ambiguous
  and `key_param` is missing.
- Walker-emitted dependents flow through the same `syncDependentResource`
  machinery as auto-detected ones, so concurrency/retry/cursor/Upsert
  behavior is identical.

Internal YAML emits this as `walker:` on the endpoint with the same
sub-field names (`parent`, `key_field`, `key_param`). Both surfaces parse
to the same `WalkerConfig` struct.

Example:

```yaml
paths:
  /games:
    get:
      summary: List games (parent for the walker below)
      responses:
        "200": {description: ok}
  /games/{game_key}/leagues:
    get:
      summary: List leagues for a game
      x-pp-sync-walker:
        parent: games
        key_field: game_key
        key_param: game_key
      parameters:
        - name: game_key
          in: path
          required: true
          schema: {type: string}
      responses:
        "200": {description: ok}
```
