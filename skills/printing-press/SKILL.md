# /printing-press

Generate the best useful CLI for an API without burning an hour on phase theater.

```bash
/printing-press Notion
/printing-press Discord codex
/printing-press --spec ./openapi.yaml
/printing-press --har ./capture.har --name MyAPI
/printing-press https://postman.com/explore
/printing-press https://postman.com
```

## What Changed In v2

The old skill inflated the path to ship:
- too many mandatory research documents before code existed
- too many separate late-stage validation phases after code existed
- too many chances to discover obvious failures late

This version uses one lean loop:
1. Resolve the spec and write one research brief
2. Generate
3. Build the highest-value gaps
4. Run one shipcheck block
5. Optionally run live API smoke tests

Artifacts are still written, but only the ones that materially help the next step.

## Modes

### Default

Normal mode. Claude does research, generation orchestration, implementation, and verification.

### Codex Mode

If the arguments include `codex` or `--codex`, offload pure code-writing tasks to Codex CLI.

Use Codex for:
- writing store/data-layer code
- writing workflow commands
- fixing dead flags / dead code / path issues
- README cookbook edits

Keep on Claude:
- research and product positioning
- choosing which gaps matter
- verification results and ship decisions

If Codex fails 3 times in a row, stop delegating and finish locally.

### Polish Mode (Standalone Skill)

For second-pass improvements to an existing CLI, use the standalone polish skill:

```bash
/printing-press-polish redfin
```

See the `printing-press-polish` skill for details. It runs diagnostics, fixes verify failures, removes dead code, cleans up descriptions and README, and offers to publish.

## Rules

- Optimize for time-to-ship, not time-to-document.
- Reuse prior research whenever it is already good enough.
- Do not split one idea across multiple mandatory artifacts.
- Do not create a separate narrative phase for dogfood, dead-code audit, runtime verification, and final score. Treat them as one shipcheck block.
- Run cheap, high-signal checks early.
- Fix blockers and high-leverage failures first.
- Reuse the same spec path across `generate`, `dogfood`, `verify`, and `scorecard`.
- YAML, JSON, local paths, and URLs are all valid spec inputs for the verification tools.
- Maximum 2 verification fix loops unless the user explicitly asks for more.

## Secret & PII Protection (Cardinal Rules)

**These rules are non-negotiable. They apply at ALL times during a run.**

API key **values**, token **values**, passwords, and session cookies must NEVER
appear in any artifact: source code, manuscripts, proofs, READMEs, HARs, or
anything committed to git. Env var **names** (e.g., `STEAM_API_KEY`) and
placeholders (e.g., `"your-key-here"`) are safe.

During Phase 5.5 (archiving) and before publishing, read and apply
[references/secret-protection.md](references/secret-protection.md) for:
- Exact-value scanning and auto-redaction of artifacts
- HAR auth stripping (headers, query strings, cookies)
- API key handling rules during the run
- Session state cleanup ordering

## Orientation & Briefing

Before setup, check whether the user provided arguments. Handle two cases:

### No Arguments: Orientation

If the user typed `/printing-press` with no arguments (no API name, no `--spec`, no `--har`, no URL), print an orientation and ask what they'd like to build:

> The Printing Press generates a fully functional CLI for any API. You give it an API name, a spec file, or a URL. It researches the landscape, catalogs every feature that exists in any competing tool, invents novel features of its own, then generates a Go CLI that matches and beats everything out there — with offline search, agent-native output, and a local SQLite data layer.
>
> By the end, you'll have a working CLI in `~/printing-press/library/` that you can use for yourself, ship on your own, or apply to add to the printing-press library.
>
> The process takes 10-40 minutes depending on API complexity. Simple APIs with official specs (Stripe, GitHub) are faster. Undocumented APIs that need discovery (ESPN, Domino's) take longer.

Then present examples and ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "What API would you like to build a CLI for?"

Options:
1. **I'll type it** — (User provides the API name, URL, or spec path via the automatic "Other" option)

Show example invocations alongside:
```
/printing-press Notion
/printing-press Discord codex
/printing-press --spec ./openapi.yaml
/printing-press --har ./capture.har --name MyAPI
/printing-press https://postman.com
```

After receiving the answer, set it as the argument and proceed to the briefing below.

### With Arguments: Briefing

When the user provided an argument (API name, `--spec`, `--har`, or URL), print a brief process overview before the setup contract runs. This sets expectations and collects any upfront context.

Print as prose (in Victorian voice):

> Very well. Setting the type for `<API>`.
>
> **Here is how this will proceed:**
> 1. I shall research `<API>` across the internet: official docs, community wrappers, competing CLIs, MCP servers, and npm/PyPI packages
> 2. I shall catalog every feature that exists in any tool, then devise novel features of my own that no existing tool offers
> 3. I shall present what I found and what I invented — you will have a chance to add your own ideas or adjust the plan before I build
> 4. I shall generate a Go CLI, build every feature from the plan, then verify quality through dogfood, runtime verification, and scoring
>
> **What you will have at the end:** A fully functional CLI at `~/printing-press/library/<api>-pp-cli` that you can use yourself, ship on your own, or apply to add to the printing-press library.
>
> **Time:** 10-40 minutes depending on API complexity.
>
> **Things that help if you have them:**
> - An API key (for live smoke testing at the end)
> - A logged-in browser session (for discovering authenticated endpoints)
> - A spec file or HAR capture (skips discovery)

If the user provided `--spec`, adapt: "You have provided a spec, so I shall skip discovery and proceed directly to analysis and generation. Should be faster."

If the user provided `--har`, adapt: "You have provided a HAR capture, so I shall generate a spec from your traffic and skip browser sniffing."

Then ask via `AskUserQuestion`:

**question:** "Anything you want me to know before I begin? A vision for what this CLI should do, specific features you care about, or context I should have?"

**options:**
1. **No, let's go** — "Start the process with default intelligence"
2. **I have context to share** — "Tell me your vision, priorities, or specific features you care about"
3. **I have an API key or I'm logged in** — "Share auth context now so I can plan for authenticated discovery and testing"

If the user selects **"No, let's go"**, proceed to Setup immediately.

If the user selects **"I have context to share"**, capture their free-text response as `USER_BRIEFING_CONTEXT`. This context will be:
- Added to the Phase 1 Research Brief under a `## User Vision` section
- Used as a 4th self-brainstorm question in Phase 1.5c.5: "Based on the user's stated vision, what features directly serve their stated goals that the absorbed features don't cover?"
- Referenced at the Phase Gate 1.5 absorb gate: "You mentioned [summary] at the start. Want to add more, or does the manifest already cover it?"

If the user selects **"I have an API key or I'm logged in"**, ask which one and capture it. Set `AUTH_CONTEXT` fields so the API Key Gate (Phase 0.5) and Pre-Sniff Auth Intelligence (Phase 1.6, if implemented) do not re-ask.

<!-- PRESS_SETUP_CONTRACT_END -->

After running the setup contract, check binary version compatibility. Read the `min-binary-version` field from this skill's YAML frontmatter. Run `printing-press version --json` and parse the version from the output. Compare it to `min-binary-version` using semver rules. If the installed binary is older than the minimum, warn the user: "printing-press binary vX.Y.Z is older than the minimum required vA.B.C. Run `go install github.com/mvanhorn/cli-printing-press/cmd/printing-press@latest` to update." Continue anyway but surface the warning prominently.

After you know `<api>`, initialize the run-scoped artifact paths:

```bash
RUN_ID="$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"
API_RUN_DIR="$PRESS_RUNSTATE/runs/$RUN_ID"
RESEARCH_DIR="$API_RUN_DIR/research"
PROOFS_DIR="$API_RUN_DIR/proofs"
PIPELINE_DIR="$API_RUN_DIR/pipeline"
DISCOVERY_DIR="$API_RUN_DIR/discovery"
CLI_WORK_DIR="$API_RUN_DIR/working/<api>-pp-cli"
STAMP="$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H%M%S)"

mkdir -p "$RESEARCH_DIR" "$PROOFS_DIR" "$PIPELINE_DIR" "$CLI_WORK_DIR"
STATE_FILE="$API_RUN_DIR/state.json"
```

Maintain a lightweight state file at `$STATE_FILE` so `/printing-press-score` can rediscover the current run. It should always contain:

```json
{
  "api_name": "<api>",
  "working_dir": "$CLI_WORK_DIR",
  "output_dir": "$CLI_WORK_DIR",
  "spec_path": "<absolute spec path if known>"
}
```

Active mutable work lives under `$PRESS_RUNSTATE/`. Published CLIs live under `$PRESS_LIBRARY/`. Archived research and verification evidence live under `$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/<cli-name>/<run-id>/` (keyed by CLI name, e.g., `steam-web-pp-cli`, not the API slug). Do not write mutable run artifacts into the repo checkout.

Examples of the current naming/layout to preserve:
- `/printing-press emboss notion-pp-cli`
- `discord-pp-cli/internal/store/store.go`
- `linear-pp-cli stale --days 30 --team ENG`
- `github.com/mvanhorn/discord-pp-cli`

## Outputs

Every run writes up to 5 concise artifacts under the current managed run and archives them to `$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/<cli-name>/<run-id>/`:

1. `research/<stamp>-feat-<api>-pp-cli-brief.md`
2. `research/<stamp>-feat-<api>-pp-cli-absorb-manifest.md`
3. `proofs/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-build-log.md`
4. `proofs/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-shipcheck.md`
5. `proofs/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-live-smoke.md` (only if live testing runs)

These do not need to be 200+ lines. Keep them dense, evidence-backed, and directly useful.

## Phase 0: Resolve And Reuse

Before new research:

1. Resolve the spec source.

   **URL Detection** — If the argument contains `://`, it's a URL. Determine whether it's a spec or a website before proceeding.

   **Step 1: Content probe.** Fetch the URL (light GET via `WebFetch`) and inspect the response:
   - Check the `Content-Type` header and the first few lines of the body.
   - If the fetch fails (timeout, 404, DNS error), skip to Step 2 — treat it as a website.

   If the content starts with `openapi:`, `swagger:`, or is valid JSON containing an `"openapi"` or `"swagger"` key → it's a spec. Treat as `--spec` and proceed directly. No disambiguation needed.

   If the content is a HAR file (JSON with `"log"` and `"entries"` keys) → treat as `--har` and proceed directly.

   **Step 2: Disambiguation.** If the content is HTML or the probe failed, ask the user what they want. Extract the site name from the hostname (e.g., `postman.com` → "Postman", `app.linear.app` → "Linear"). Derive `<api>` from the site name using the same `cleanSpecName` normalization the generator uses.

   Use `AskUserQuestion` with:
   - **question:** `"What kind of CLI do you want for <SiteName>?"`
   - **header:** `"CLI target"`
   - **multiSelect:** `false`
   - **options:**
     1. **label:** `"<SiteName>'s official API"` — **description:** `"Build a CLI for <SiteName>'s documented API (e.g. REST endpoints, webhooks, OAuth)"`
     2. **label:** `"The <SiteName> website itself"` — **description:** `"Build a CLI that does what the website does — I'll figure out the underlying API by exploring the site"`

   The user can also pick the automatic "Other" option to describe what they're after in free text.

   **Routing after disambiguation:**
   - "<SiteName>'s official API" → use `<api>` as the argument, proceed with normal discovery (Phase 1 research, then Phase 1.7 sniff gate evaluates independently as usual)
   - "The <SiteName> website itself" → use `<api>` as the argument, set `SNIFF_TARGET_URL=<url>`. Proceed to Phase 1 research. When Phase 1.7 is reached, skip the sniff gate decision and go directly to "If user approves sniff" (the user already approved in Phase 0 — do not re-ask). Use `SNIFF_TARGET_URL` as the starting URL for browser capture.
   - "Other" → read the user's free-form response and adapt

   **End of URL detection.** The remaining spec resolution rules apply when the argument is NOT a URL:

   - If the user passed `--har <path>`, this is a HAR-first run. Run `printing-press sniff --har <path> --name <api> --output "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-sniff-spec.yaml"` to generate a spec from captured traffic. Use the generated spec as the primary spec source for the rest of the pipeline. Skip the sniff gate in Phase 1.7 (sniff already ran).
   - If the user passed `--spec`, use it directly (existing behavior).
   - Otherwise, proceed with normal discovery (catalog, KnownSpecs, apis-guru, web search).
2. Check for prior research in:
   - `$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/<cli-name>/*/research/*` (also check `$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/<api>/*/research/*` for backwards compatibility)
   - `$REPO_ROOT/docs/plans/*<api>*` (legacy fallback)
3. Reuse good prior work instead of redoing it.
4. **Library Check** — Check if a CLI for this API already exists in the library or is actively being built, and present the user with context and options.

   First, check lock status to detect active builds:

   ```bash
   LOCK_STATUS=$(printing-press lock status --cli <api>-pp-cli --json 2>/dev/null)
   LOCK_HELD=$(echo "$LOCK_STATUS" | grep -o '"held"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[a-z]*' | head -1 | sed 's/.*: *//')
   LOCK_STALE=$(echo "$LOCK_STATUS" | grep -o '"stale"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[a-z]*' | head -1 | sed 's/.*: *//')
   LOCK_PHASE=$(echo "$LOCK_STATUS" | grep -o '"phase"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | head -1 | sed 's/.*"phase"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"//;s/"//')
   LOCK_AGE=$(echo "$LOCK_STATUS" | grep -o '"age_seconds"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*[0-9]*' | head -1 | sed 's/.*: *//')
   ```

   Then check the library directory:

   ```bash
   CLI_DIR="$PRESS_LIBRARY/<api>-pp-cli"
   HAS_LIBRARY=false
   HAS_GOMOD=false
   if [ -d "$CLI_DIR" ]; then
     HAS_LIBRARY=true
     if [ -f "$CLI_DIR/go.mod" ]; then
       HAS_GOMOD=true
     fi
     # Read manifest if available
     MANIFEST="$CLI_DIR/.printing-press.json"
     if [ -f "$MANIFEST" ]; then
       PRESS_VERSION=$(cat "$MANIFEST" | grep -o '"printing_press_version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | head -1 | sed 's/.*"printing_press_version"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"//;s/"//')
       GENERATED_AT=$(cat "$MANIFEST" | grep -o '"generated_at"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"[^"]*"' | head -1 | sed 's/.*"generated_at"[[:space:]]*:[[:space:]]*"//;s/"//')
     fi
     # Get directory modification time as fallback
     CLI_MTIME=$(stat -f "%Sm" -t "%Y-%m-%d" "$CLI_DIR" 2>/dev/null || stat -c "%y" "$CLI_DIR" 2>/dev/null | cut -d' ' -f1)
   fi
   ```

   **Decision matrix:**

   | Library dir? | Lock? | Stale? | Has go.mod? | Action |
   |-------------|-------|--------|-------------|--------|
   | No | No | N/A | N/A | Proceed normally |
   | No | Yes | No | N/A | Warn: "Actively being built (phase: `<phase>`, `<age>` seconds ago). Wait, use a different name, or pick a different API." |
   | No | Yes | Yes | N/A | Offer reclaim: "Interrupted build detected (stale since `<age>`s ago). Reclaim and start fresh?" |
   | Yes | No | N/A | Yes | Existing "Found existing" flow (see below) |
   | Yes | No | N/A | No | Debris: "Found `<cli-name>` directory in library but it appears incomplete (no go.mod). Clean up and start fresh?" If user approves, `rm -rf "$CLI_DIR"` and proceed normally. |
   | Yes | Yes | No | Any | Warn: "Actively being rebuilt (phase: `<phase>`, `<age>` seconds ago). Wait, use a different name, or pick a different API." |
   | Yes | Yes | Yes | Any | Offer reclaim: "Interrupted rebuild detected (stale since `<age>`s ago). Reclaim and start fresh?" |

   **If actively locked (not stale):** Present via `AskUserQuestion` with options to wait, pick a different API, or force-reclaim (`printing-press lock acquire --cli <api>-pp-cli --scope "$PRESS_SCOPE" --force`).

   **If stale lock:** Reclaiming is automatic on `lock acquire` in Phase 2. If user approves, proceed normally — the lock acquire in Phase 2 will auto-reclaim the stale lock.

   **If library exists with go.mod and no lock (completed CLI):** Display context and present options using `AskUserQuestion`:

   > Found existing `<cli-name>` in library (last modified `<date>`).

   If `PRESS_VERSION` is available, append: `Built with printing-press v<version>.`

   If prior research was also found (step 2), include the research summary alongside the library info.

   Then ask:
   1. **"Generate a fresh CLI"** — Re-runs the generator into a working directory, overwrites generated code, then rebuilds transcendence features. Prior research is reused if recent. ~15-20 min.
   2. **"Improve existing CLI"** — Keeps all current code, audits for quality gaps, implements top improvements. The generator is not re-run. ~10 min.
   3. **"Review prior research first"** — Show the full research brief and absorb manifest before deciding.

   If the user picks option 1, proceed to Phase 1 (research) and then Phase 2 (generate) as normal.
   If the user picks option 2, invoke `/printing-press-polish <cli-name>` to improve the existing CLI.
   If the user picks option 3, display the prior research, then re-present options 1 and 2.

   If no CLI exists in the library and no lock is active, skip this step and proceed normally.

5. **API Key Gate** — Check whether this API requires authentication, then handle accordingly.

**First, determine if the API needs auth.** Use these signals:
- The spec has no `security` or `securityDefinitions` section → likely no auth needed
- The API's endpoints are accessible without authentication (e.g., ESPN's undocumented endpoints, weather APIs, public data feeds) — note: "no auth required" does NOT mean the service has an official public API
- No env var matching the API name exists AND no known token pattern applies
- Community docs or npm/PyPI wrappers describe the API as "no auth required"

**If no auth is required**, skip the key gate entirely. Proceed with: "No authentication required for `<API>` — skipping API key gate." Do NOT call it "a public API" unless the service officially publishes one. Many services (ESPN, etc.) have unauthenticated endpoints without having an official API. Live smoke testing in Phase 5 will work without a key.

**If the API DOES require auth**, run the key gate:

Token detection order:
- GitHub: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GH_TOKEN`, or `gh auth token`
- Discord: `DISCORD_TOKEN`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`
- Linear: `LINEAR_API_KEY`
- Notion: `NOTION_TOKEN`
- Stripe: `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`
- Generic: `API_KEY`, `API_TOKEN`

**If a token IS found**, stop and explain:
> Found `<ENV_VAR>` in your environment. This key will be used **only** for read-only live smoke testing in Phase 5 — listing, fetching, and health checks. It will never be used for write operations (create, update, delete). OK to use it?

- If the user approves → proceed with the key available for Phase 5.
- If the user declines → proceed without the key and display: "Live smoke testing (Phase 5) will be skipped. The CLI will still be generated and verified against mock responses."

**If no token is found**, stop and ask:
> No API key detected for `<API>`. You can provide one now for read-only live smoke testing in Phase 5, or continue without it.
>
> Set it with `export <ENV_VAR>=<your-key>` or paste the key here.

- If the user provides a key → proceed with the key available for Phase 5.
- If the user declines → proceed without the key and display: "Live smoke testing (Phase 5) will be skipped. The CLI will still be generated and verified against mock responses."

Resolve the API key gate (or skip it for public APIs) before moving to Phase 1.

## Phase 1: Research Brief

**When `SNIFF_TARGET_URL` is set:** Skip the catalog check, spec/docs search, and SDK wrapper search — none of these exist for an undocumented website feature. Focus research on understanding what the site/feature does, who uses it, what workflows it supports, and what competitors offer similar functionality. The spec will come from sniffing in Phase 1.7.

Before starting research, check if the API has a built-in catalog entry:

```bash
printing-press catalog show <api> --json 2>/dev/null
```

If the catalog has an entry for this API, present the user with a choice:

> "<API> is in the built-in catalog (spec: <spec_url>). Use the catalog config to skip discovery, or run full discovery?"

- If catalog config: use the spec_url from the catalog entry, skip the research/discovery phase
- If full discovery: proceed with the normal research workflow
- If the catalog doesn't have this API: proceed normally without mentioning the catalog

Write one build-driving brief, not a stack of phase essays.

The brief must answer:

1. What is this API actually used for?
2. What are the top 3-5 power-user workflows?
3. What are the top table-stakes competitor features?
4. What data deserves a local store?
5. Why would someone install this CLI instead of the incumbent?
6. What is the product name and thesis?

Research checklist:
- Find the spec or docs source
- Find the top 1-2 competitors
- **Check GitHub issues on the top wrapper/SDK repo for "403", "blocked", "broken", "deprecated", "rate limit".** If multiple issues report the API is inaccessible or broken, flag this in the research brief as a reachability risk. This is critical for unofficial/reverse-engineered APIs.
- Find official and popular SDK wrappers on npm (`site:npmjs.com`) and PyPI (`site:pypi.org`)
- Find 2-3 concrete user pain points
- Identify the highest-gravity entities
- Pick the top 3-5 commands that matter most

Do not produce separate mandatory documents for:
- workflow ideation
- parity audit
- data-layer prediction
- product thesis

Put them in the one brief.

Write:

`$RESEARCH_DIR/<stamp>-feat-<api>-pp-cli-brief.md`

Suggested shape:

```markdown
# <API> CLI Brief

```

**MANDATORY: Before proceeding to Phase 1.5 (Absorb Gate), you MUST evaluate Phase 1.6 (Pre-Sniff Auth Intelligence), Phase 1.7 (Sniff Gate), and Phase 1.8 (Crowd Sniff Gate) below.** If no spec source has been resolved yet (no `--spec`, no `--har`, no catalog spec URL), the sniff gate decision matrix MUST be evaluated. Do not skip to Phase 1.5.

## Phase 1.6: Pre-Sniff Auth Intelligence

After Phase 1 research completes, analyze findings to proactively assess what auth context the user could provide. This step uses research intelligence to ask the right question before sniffing starts, rather than waiting for the user to volunteer "I logged in."

**Skip this step if:** The briefing (Orientation & Briefing section) already captured auth context (`AUTH_CONTEXT` is set from the user selecting "I have an API key or I'm logged in").

**Classify the API's auth profile from research findings:**

| Signal from research | Auth profile | What to ask |
|---------------------|-------------|-------------|
| Community wrappers use API keys (e.g., `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`), MCP source shows `Authorization: Bearer` headers, spec has `security` section | **API key auth** | "Do you have an API key for `<API>`?" |
| Site has user accounts, research found auth-only features (order history, saved items, rewards, account settings), login pages exist | **Browser session auth** | "This API has authenticated endpoints ([list specific features from research, e.g., order history, saved addresses, rewards]). Are you logged in to `<site>` in your browser? The sniff will find more endpoints if you are." |
| Endpoints accessible without auth, no login-gated features found, community wrappers describe API as "no auth required" | **No auth needed** | Skip this step silently |
| Both API key AND browser session features found | **Dual auth** | Ask about both: API key for smoke testing, browser session for sniff |

**Name the specific features the user would unlock.** Do not say "auth would help." Say "This API has order history, saved addresses, and rewards that require a logged-in session."

**Where signals come from:**
- Phase 1 brief's "Data profile" and "Top Workflows" sections
- Phase 1.5a MCP source code analysis (auth patterns, token formats)
- Community wrapper README "auth" or "authentication" sections
- The API Key Gate's token detection (Phase 0.5) — if it already found a key, don't re-ask

**For API key auth:** Present via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "Do you have an API key for `<API>`? It will be used for read-only live smoke testing in Phase 5."
>
> 1. **Yes** — user provides the key or confirms it's in the environment
> 2. **No, continue without it** — skip live smoke testing

If the user provides a key, set it in `AUTH_CONTEXT` so the API Key Gate (Phase 0.5) does not re-ask.

**For browser session auth:** Present via `AskUserQuestion`:
> "`<API>` has authenticated endpoints ([list features]). Are you logged in to `<site>` in your browser? If so, the generated CLI will support `auth login --chrome` — you'll be able to authenticate just by being logged into the site in Chrome. No API key needed."
>
> 1. **Yes, I'm logged in** — I'll use your session during sniff and enable browser auth in the CLI
> 2. **No, but I can log in** — I'll help you log in before sniffing
> 3. **No, skip authenticated endpoints** — sniff only public endpoints

Set `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=true` if the user selects option 1 or 2. The Sniff Gate (Phase 1.7) will use this flag. After traffic capture, Step 2d in [references/sniff-capture.md](references/sniff-capture.md) validates that cookie replay works before enabling browser auth in the generated CLI.

**For dual auth:** Ask about both in sequence — API key first (simple env var check), then browser session.

---

## Phase 1.7: Sniff Gate

After Phase 1 research, evaluate whether sniffing the live site would improve the spec. Skip this gate entirely if the user already passed `--har` or `--spec` (spec source is already resolved). If `SNIFF_TARGET_URL` is set (user chose "The website itself" in Phase 0), skip the decision matrix and go directly to "If user approves sniff" — the user already approved, and `SNIFF_TARGET_URL` is the starting URL.

**IMPORTANT:** When the decision matrix below says "Offer sniff", you MUST ask the user via `AskUserQuestion`. Do NOT silently decide to skip sniff because the docs look thorough — the user should make that call. The only case where you skip silently is "spec appears complete" (no gap detected).

**Time budget:** The sniff gate should complete within 3 minutes of the user approving sniff. If browser automation tooling fails to produce results after 3 minutes of attempts, fall back immediately:
- If a spec already exists (enrichment mode): "Sniff failed after 3 minutes — proceeding with existing spec."
- If no spec exists (primary mode): "Sniff failed after 3 minutes — falling back to --docs generation."
Do NOT spend time debugging tool integration issues. The sniff is optional enrichment, not a blocking requirement. If the first approach fails, fall back to the next option — do not retry the same broken approach.

### When to offer sniff

| Spec found? | Research shows gaps? | Auth required? | Action |
|-------------|---------------------|----------------|--------|
| Yes | Yes — docs or competitors show significantly more endpoints than the spec | No | **MUST offer sniff as enrichment** |
| Yes | No — spec appears complete | Any | Skip silently |
| No | Community docs exist (e.g., Public-ESPN-API) | No | **MUST offer sniff OR --docs** — present both options so the user decides |
| No | No docs found either | No | **MUST offer sniff as primary discovery** |
| No | N/A | Yes (login) + `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=true` | **Offer authenticated sniff** — the user confirmed a session in Phase 1.6 |
| No | N/A | Yes (login) + `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=false` | Skip — fall back to `--docs` |

**Gap detection heuristic:** If Phase 1 research found documentation, competitor tools, or community projects that reference significantly more endpoints or features than the resolved spec covers, that's a gap signal. Example: "The Zuplo OpenAPI spec has 42 endpoints, but the Public-ESPN-API docs describe 370+."

### Sniff as enrichment (spec exists but has gaps)

Present to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Found a spec with **N endpoints**, but research shows the live API likely has more (competitors reference M+ features). Want me to sniff `<url>` to discover endpoints the spec missed? I'll check for browser-use or agent-browser and install if needed."
>
> Options:
> 1. **Yes — sniff and merge** (browse the site, capture traffic, merge discovered endpoints with the existing spec. Installs capture tools if needed.)
> 2. **No — use existing spec** (proceed with what we have)

### Sniff as primary (no spec found)

Present to the user via `AskUserQuestion`. **If `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=true`**, include an authenticated sniff option:

> "No OpenAPI spec found for `<API>`. Want me to sniff `<likely-url>` to discover the API from live traffic?"
>
> Options:
> 1. **Yes — authenticated sniff** (use your browser session to discover both public and authenticated endpoints. Recommended since you confirmed a session.) *(Only show when `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=true`)*
> 2. **Yes — sniff the live site** (browse `<url>` anonymously, capture API calls, generate a spec. Installs capture tools if needed.)
> 3. **No — use docs instead** (attempt `--docs` generation from documentation pages)
> 4. **No — I'll provide a spec or HAR** (user will supply input manually)

When `AUTH_SESSION_AVAILABLE=false`, show only options 2-4 (the existing 3-option prompt).

### If user approves sniff

#### Step 0: Identify the User Goal

Before building the capture plan, answer one question: **What does the end user of this CLI actually want to do?**

Read the research brief's Top Workflows. The #1 workflow IS the primary sniff goal. State it in one sentence:
- Domino's: "Order a pizza for delivery"
- Linear: "Create an issue and assign it to a sprint"
- Stripe: "Create a payment intent and confirm it"
- ESPN: "Check today's scores and standings"
- Notion: "Create a page and organize it in a database"

If the API is read-only (news, weather, data feeds), the primary goal is "fetch and filter data" and the flow is search/filter/paginate rather than a multi-step transaction.

The sniff will walk through this goal as an interactive user flow. Secondary workflows become secondary sniff passes if time permits.

State the goal explicitly before proceeding: "Primary sniff goal: [goal]. I will walk through this as a user flow."

Then read and follow [references/sniff-capture.md](references/sniff-capture.md) for the complete
sniff implementation: tool detection, installation, session transfer, browser-use/agent-browser
capture, HAR analysis, and discovery report writing.

### If user declines sniff

Proceed with whatever spec source exists. If no spec was found, fall back to `--docs` or ask the user to provide a spec/HAR manually.

---

## Phase 1.8: Crowd Sniff Gate

After Phase 1.7 (Sniff Gate), evaluate whether mining community signals (npm SDKs and GitHub code search) would improve the spec. Skip this gate entirely if the user already passed `--spec` (spec source is already resolved and appears complete).

**Time budget:** The crowd sniff gate should complete within 5 minutes. If `printing-press crowd-sniff` fails or times out, fall back immediately:
- If a spec already exists: "Crowd sniff failed — proceeding with existing spec."
- If no spec exists: "Crowd sniff failed — falling back to --docs generation."

### When to offer crowd sniff

| Spec found? | Research shows gaps? | Action |
|-------------|---------------------|--------|
| Yes | Yes — competitors or community projects reference more endpoints | **Offer crowd sniff as enrichment** |
| Yes | No — spec appears complete | Skip silently |
| No | Community SDKs exist on npm | **Offer crowd sniff as primary discovery** |
| No | No SDKs or code found | Skip — fall back to `--docs` |

### Crowd sniff as enrichment (spec exists but has gaps)

Present to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "Found a spec with **N endpoints**, but research shows the live API likely has more. Want me to search npm packages and GitHub code for `<api>` to discover additional endpoints? This typically takes 2-4 minutes."
>
> Options:
> 1. **Yes — crowd sniff and merge** (search npm SDKs and GitHub code, merge discovered endpoints with the existing spec)
> 2. **No — use existing spec** (proceed with what we have)

### Crowd sniff as primary (no spec found)

Present to the user via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "No OpenAPI spec found for `<API>`. Want me to search npm packages and GitHub code to discover the API from community usage? This typically takes 2-4 minutes."
>
> Options:
> 1. **Yes — crowd sniff the community** (search npm SDKs and GitHub code, generate a spec from discovered endpoints)
> 2. **No — use docs instead** (attempt `--docs` generation from documentation pages)
> 3. **No — I'll provide a spec or HAR** (user will supply input manually)

### If user approves crowd sniff

Read and follow [references/crowd-sniff.md](references/crowd-sniff.md) for the crowd-sniff
command, provenance capture, and discovery report writing.

### If user declines crowd sniff

Proceed with whatever spec source exists. If no spec was found, fall back to `--docs` or ask the user to provide a spec/HAR manually.

---

## Phase 1.5: Ecosystem Absorb Gate

THIS IS A MANDATORY STOP GATE. Do not generate until this is complete and approved.

**Pre-check:** If no spec or HAR file has been resolved by this point and Phase 1.7 (Sniff Gate) was not evaluated, STOP. Go back and run the sniff gate decision matrix. The absorb manifest depends on knowing the API surface, which requires a spec.

The GOAT CLI doesn't "find gaps." It absorbs EVERY feature from EVERY tool and then transcends with compound use cases nobody thought of. This phase builds the absorb manifest.

### Step 1.5a: Search for every tool that touches this API

Run these searches in parallel:

1. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" Claude Code plugin site:github.com`
2. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" MCP server model context protocol`
3. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" Claude skill SKILL.md site:github.com`
4. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" CLI tool site:github.com` (competing CLIs)
5. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" CLI site:npmjs.com` (npm packages)
6. **WebFetch**: Check `github.com/anthropics/claude-plugins-official/tree/main/external_plugins` for official plugin
7. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" MCP site:lobehub.com OR site:mcpmarket.com OR site:fastmcp.me`
8. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" automation script workflow site:github.com`
9. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" SDK wrapper site:npmjs.com`
10. **WebSearch**: `"<API name>" client library site:pypi.org`

### Step 1.5a.5: Read MCP source code (if found)

If step 1.5a discovered MCP server repos with public source code on GitHub, read the actual source to extract ground-truth API usage — not just README feature descriptions.

**Time budget:** Max 3 minutes total. If extraction is unproductive, fall back to README-only research.

**For the top 1-2 MCP repos found:**

1. **Identify the main source file.** WebFetch the repo root to find the entry point — typically `src/index.ts`, `server.ts`, `server.py`, `main.go`, or a `tools/` directory. MCP servers are usually small (one main file + tool definitions).

2. **Extract three things:**
   - **API endpoint paths**: Look for HTTP client calls (`fetch(`, `axios.`, `requests.`, `http.Get`, `client.`) and extract the URL paths (e.g., `GET /v1/issues`, `POST /graphql`). These are the endpoints the MCP maintainer proved work.
   - **Auth patterns**: Look for how the MCP constructs auth headers — token format (`Bearer`, `Bot`, `Basic`), header name (`Authorization`, `X-API-Key`), environment variable names. This informs our auth setup guidance.
   - **Response field selections**: Look for which fields are extracted from API responses — these are the high-gravity fields that power users actually need.

3. **Feed into absorb manifest.** In step 1.5b, endpoints extracted from source get attributed as `<MCP name> (source)` in the "Best Source" column, distinguishing them from README-derived features. Source-extracted endpoints are high-confidence signals — the maintainer verified they work.

4. **Feed auth patterns into research brief.** If the MCP source reveals token format (e.g., `xoxp-` for Slack, `sk_live_` for Stripe), credential setup steps, or required scopes, note them in the Phase 1 brief's auth section. These hints improve the generated CLI's auth onboarding.

**Skip this step when:**
- No MCP repos were found in 1.5a
- MCP repos are private or archived
- The MCP is a monorepo where the relevant server is hard to locate within 3 minutes

### Step 1.5b: Catalog every feature into the absorb manifest

For EACH tool found, list EVERY feature/tool/command it provides. Then define how our CLI matches AND beats it:

```markdown
## Absorb Manifest

### Absorbed (match or beat everything that exists)
| # | Feature | Best Source | Our Implementation | Added Value |
|---|---------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 1 | Search issues by text | Linear MCP search_issues | FTS5 offline search | Works offline, regex, SQL composable |
| 2 | Create issue | Linear MCP create_issue | --stdin batch, --dry-run | Agent-native, scriptable, idempotent |
| 3 | Sprint board view | jira-cli sprint view | SQLite-backed sprint query | Historical velocity, offline |
```

Every row = a feature we MUST build. No exceptions. If someone else has it, we have it AND it works offline, with --json, --dry-run, typed exit codes, and SQLite persistence.

SDK wrapper methods should be treated as features to absorb — each public method/function is a feature the CLI should match.

### Step 1.5c: Identify compound use cases

What compound use cases become possible ONLY when ALL absorbed features live in SQLite together?

```markdown
### Transcendence (only possible with our local data layer)
| # | Feature | Command | Why Only We Can Do This |
|---|---------|---------|------------------------|
| 1 | Bottleneck detection | bottleneck | Requires local join across issues + assignees + cycle data |
| 2 | Velocity trends | velocity --weeks 4 | Requires historical cycle snapshots in SQLite |
| 3 | Duplicate detection | similar "login bug" | Requires FTS5 across ALL issue text + comments |
```

Minimum 5 compound use case features. These are the NOI commands.

### Step 1.5c.5: Auto-Suggest Novel Features

**This step runs automatically.** Read [references/absorb-scoring.md](references/absorb-scoring.md)
for the gap analysis framework, scoring dimensions, and candidate generation process.

### Step 1.5d: Write the manifest artifact

Write to `$RESEARCH_DIR/<stamp>-feat-<api>-pp-cli-absorb-manifest.md`

The manifest now includes compound use cases (Step 1.5c) and auto-suggested + auto-brainstormed features (Step 1.5c.5) in the transcendence table.

### Step 1.5e: Write research.json for README credits

After writing the absorb manifest, also write `$API_RUN_DIR/research.json` so the generator can credit community projects in the README. This file MUST match the `ResearchResult` JSON schema that `loadResearchSources()` expects.

Populate the `alternatives` array from the absorb manifest's source tools list. Include only tools that:
1. Have a GitHub URL (not npm/PyPI landing pages)
2. Actually contributed features to the absorb manifest
3. Are capped at 8 entries, ordered by number of absorbed features (then by stars)

```bash
cat > "$API_RUN_DIR/research.json" <<REOF
{
  "api_name": "<api>",
  "novelty_score": 0,
  "alternatives": [
    {"name": "<tool1>", "url": "<github-url>", "language": "<Go|JavaScript|Python|etc>", "stars": <N>, "command_count": <N>},
    ...
  ],
  "gaps": [],
  "patterns": [],
  "recommendation": "proceed",
  "researched_at": "$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"
}
REOF
```

For each tool, fill in what you know from the research. Stars and command_count are optional (use 0 if unknown). The `language` field should match the primary implementation language. Skip tools that were found during search but contributed zero features to the manifest.

Also write discovery pages if sniff was used. The generator reads these from `$API_RUN_DIR/discovery/sniff-report.md` (which the sniff gate already writes there). No additional action needed for discovery pages -- they are already in the right location.

### Phase Gate 1.5

**STOP.** Present the absorb manifest to the user in two parts: a prose showcase, then a question.

**Part 1: Prose showcase (print before the AskUserQuestion)**

Print as regular text output:

> ## Absorb Summary
>
> I cataloged **[N] features** across [X] tools ([tool names]). Our CLI will match every one of them with offline search, --json output, and agent-native flags.
>
> ## Novel Features (my ideas, not found in any existing tool)
>
> Beyond absorbing what exists, I came up with [M] features that no existing tool has. Here are the top 3:
>
> 1. **[Feature name]** ([score]/10) — [one-line description]. Evidence: [what research finding inspired this].
> 2. **[Feature name]** ([score]/10) — [one-line description]. Evidence: [source].
> 3. **[Feature name]** ([score]/10) — [one-line description]. Evidence: [source].
>
> Plus [M-3] more in the full manifest.
>
> Total: [N+M] features, [Z]% more than [best existing tool name] ([best tool feature count]).

If fewer than 3 novel features scored >= 5/10, show all qualifying features instead of "top 3." If 0 qualified, note: "No novel features scored high enough to recommend. The absorbed features cover the landscape well."

**Part 2: AskUserQuestion**

> "Ready to generate with the full [N+M]-feature manifest? Or do you have ideas to add?"

Options:
1. **Approve — generate now** — Start CLI generation with the full manifest
2. **I have ideas to add** — Tell me features from your experience, then we'll generate
3. **Review full manifest** — Show me every absorbed and novel feature before deciding
4. **Trim scope** — The feature count is too ambitious, let's focus on a subset

If user selects **"I have ideas to add"**, ask 3 structured questions targeting personal knowledge the research couldn't surface:

1. "Beyond the [M] ideas above, what workflows do YOU use `<API>` for that we might have missed?"
2. "What frustrates YOU about this API that the research didn't surface?"
3. "What's YOUR killer feature — something only you'd think of?"

If `USER_BRIEFING_CONTEXT` is non-empty, acknowledge it: "You mentioned [summary of their vision] at the start. Want to add more, or does the manifest already cover it?"

Each answer that produces a concrete feature → score and add to the transcendence table. After the brainstorm, return to this gate with the updated manifest.
WAIT for approval. Do NOT generate until approved.

---

## Phase 1.9: API Reachability Gate

**MANDATORY. Do NOT skip this phase. Do NOT proceed to Phase 2 without running this check.**

Before spending tokens on generation, verify the API actually responds to programmatic requests. One real HTTP call. If it fails, STOP.

### The Check

Pick the simplest GET endpoint from the resolved spec (no required params, no auth if possible). If no such endpoint exists, use the spec's base URL. Run one HTTP request:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" -m 10 "<base_url>/<simplest_get_path>" 2>/dev/null
```

Or use `WebFetch` if curl is unavailable. The goal is one real response code.

### Decision Matrix

| Result | Sniff gate failed? | Research found 403 issues? | Action |
|--------|-------------------|---------------------------|--------|
| 2xx/3xx | Any | Any | **PASS** - proceed to Phase 2 |
| 401 (no key provided) | No | No | **PASS** - expected when API needs auth and user declined key gate |
| 403 with HTML/bot detection | Any | Any | **HARD STOP** |
| 403 | Yes (bot detection) | Any | **HARD STOP** |
| 403 | No | Yes (issues found) | **HARD STOP** |
| 403 | No | No | **WARN** - ask user |
| Timeout/DNS/connection refused | Any | Any | **WARN** - ask user |

### On HARD STOP

Present via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "WARNING: `<API>` appears to block programmatic access. [what failed: e.g., 'HTTP 403 with HTML error page', 'sniff gate failed with bot detection', 'reteps/redfin has 6+ issues about 403 errors']. Building a CLI against an unreachable API wastes time and tokens."
>
> 1. **Try anyway** - proceed knowing the CLI may not work against the live API
> 2. **Pick a different API** - start over
> 3. **Done** - stop here

### On WARN

Present via `AskUserQuestion`:

> "The API returned [error]. This might be temporary, or it might mean programmatic access is blocked. Want to proceed?"
>
> 1. **Yes - proceed** - generate the CLI anyway
> 2. **No - stop** - pick a different API or provide a spec manually

### On PASS

Proceed silently to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Generate

Use the resolved spec source and generate immediately.

Before running any generate command, acquire the build lock:

```bash
printing-press lock acquire --cli <api>-pp-cli --scope "$PRESS_SCOPE"
```

If acquire fails (another session holds a fresh lock), present the lock status to the user and let them decide: wait, use a different CLI name, force-reclaim, or pick a different API.

OpenAPI / internal YAML:

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec <spec-path-or-url> \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --force --lenient --validate
```

Sniff-enriched (original spec + sniff-discovered spec):

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec <original-spec-path-or-url> \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-sniff-spec.yaml" \
  --name <api> \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --spec-source sniffed \
  --force --lenient --validate
# If proxy pattern was detected during sniff, add:
#   --client-pattern proxy-envelope
```

Sniff-only (no original spec, sniff was the primary source):

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-sniff-spec.yaml" \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --spec-source sniffed \
  --force --lenient --validate
# If proxy pattern was detected during sniff, add:
#   --client-pattern proxy-envelope
```

Crowd-sniff-enriched (original spec + crowd-discovered spec):

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec <original-spec-path-or-url> \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-crowd-spec.yaml" \
  --name <api> \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --force --lenient --validate
```

Crowd-sniff-only (no original spec, crowd sniff was the primary source):

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-crowd-spec.yaml" \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --force --lenient --validate
```

Both sniff + crowd-sniff (merged with original):

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --spec <original-spec-path-or-url> \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-sniff-spec.yaml" \
  --spec "$RESEARCH_DIR/<api>-crowd-spec.yaml" \
  --name <api> \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --force --lenient --validate
```

Docs-only:

```bash
printing-press generate \
  --docs <docs-url> \
  --name <api> \
  --output "$CLI_WORK_DIR" \
  --research-dir "$API_RUN_DIR" \
  --force --validate
```

GraphQL-only APIs:
- Generate scaffolding only in Phase 2
- Build real commands in Phase 3 using a GraphQL client wrapper

After generation:

**REQUIRED: Rewrite the CLI description.** The generator copies the spec's `description` field
as the CLI's `Short` help text. Spec descriptions describe the *API* ("Payment processing API")
but CLI help should describe what the *CLI does* ("Manage payments, subscriptions, and invoices
via the Stripe API"). Open `$CLI_WORK_DIR/internal/cli/root.go`, find the
`Short:` field on the root cobra command, and rewrite it as a concise, user-facing description
of the CLI's purpose. Use the product thesis from the Phase 1 brief to inform the rewrite.

**REQUIRED: Preserve README sections.** The generated README contains 5 standard sections
that the scorecard checks for: Quick Start, Agent Usage, Health Check, Troubleshooting, and
Cookbook. When rewriting the README for this API during Phase 3, **preserve all 5 sections**.
You may add additional sections that help users of this specific API (e.g., "Rate Limits",
"Pagination", "Authentication Setup"), but never remove the standard ones.

**REQUIRED: Compensate for missing auth.** Check if the generated `config.go` has auth
env var support (look for `os.Getenv` calls for API key variables). If not, check the
Phase 1 research brief for auth requirements. If the brief identifies an API key, token,
or auth method that the spec didn't declare, add the appropriate env var support to
`config.go`. Use the pattern: add `APIKey`/`APIKeySource` fields to the Config struct,
and `os.Getenv("<API>_API_KEY")` in the Load function. The research brief is the
authoritative source when the spec is silent on auth.

After the description rewrite, update the lock heartbeat:

```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase generate
```

Then:
- note skipped complex body fields
- fix only blocking generation failures here
- do not start broad polish work yet

If generation fails:
- fix the specific blocker
- retry at most 2 times
- prefer generator fixes over manual generated-code surgery when the failure is systemic
- if retries are exhausted, release the lock and stop:
  ```bash
  printing-press lock release --cli <api>-pp-cli
  ```

## Phase 3: Build The GOAT

<!-- CODEX_PHASE3_START -->
When `CODEX_MODE` is true, read [references/codex-delegation.md](references/codex-delegation.md)
for the delegation pattern, task type templates, and circuit breaker logic.

When `CODEX_MODE` is false, skip this section.
<!-- CODEX_PHASE3_END -->

Build comprehensively. The absorb manifest from Phase 1.5 IS the feature list.

Priority 0 (foundation):
- data layer for ALL primary entities from the manifest
- sync/search/SQL path - this is what makes transcendence possible

After completing Priority 0, update the lock heartbeat:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase build-p0
```

Priority 1 (absorb - match everything):
- ALL absorbed features from the Phase 1.5 manifest
- Every feature from every competing tool, matched and beaten with agent-native output
- This is NOT "top 3-5" - it is the FULL manifest

**Lock heartbeat rule for long priority levels:** If Priority 1 has more than 5 features, update the lock heartbeat after every 3-5 features to prevent the 30-minute staleness threshold from triggering mid-build:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase build-p1-progress
```

Priority 2 (transcend - build what nobody else has):
- ALL transcendence features from Phase 1.5
- The NOI commands that only work because everything is in SQLite
- These are the commands that make someone say "I need this"

**Lock heartbeat rule for Priority 2:** Same rule as Priority 1 — if Priority 2 has more than 3 transcendence features, update the heartbeat after every 2-3 features:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase build-p2-progress
```

After completing Priority 2, update the lock heartbeat:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase build-p2
```

Priority 3 (polish):
- skipped complex request bodies that block important commands
- naming cleanup for ugly operationId-derived commands
- tests for non-trivial store/workflow logic
- enrich terse flag descriptions: review generated command flags. If any description is under 5 words or is generic spec-derived text (e.g., "access key", "The player"), improve it using the research brief. For example, change "access key" to "Steam API key (get one at steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey)". Focus on auth keys, IDs, and filter parameters.

### Agent Build Checklist (per command)

After building each command in Priority 1 and Priority 2, verify these 7 principles are met. These map 1:1 to what Phase 4.9's agent readiness reviewer will check - apply them now so the review becomes a confirmation, not a catch-all.

1. **Non-interactive**: No TTY prompts, no `bufio.Scanner(os.Stdin)`, works in CI without a terminal
2. **Structured output**: `--json` produces valid JSON, `--select` filters fields correctly
3. **Progressive help**: `--help` shows realistic examples with domain-specific values (not "abc123")
4. **Actionable errors**: Error messages name the specific flag/arg that's wrong and the correct usage
5. **Safe retries**: Mutation commands support `--dry-run`, idempotent where possible
6. **Composability**: Exit codes are typed (0/2/3/4/5/7), output pipes to `jq` cleanly
7. **Bounded responses**: `--compact` returns only high-gravity fields, list commands have `--limit`

### Search Dedup Rule

When building cross-entity search commands, use per-table FTS search methods individually. Do NOT combine per-table search with the generic `db.Search()` — this causes duplicate results because the same entities exist in both `resources_fts` and per-table FTS indexes.

### Priority 1 Review Gate

After completing ALL Priority 1 (absorbed) features, BEFORE starting Priority 2 (transcendence):

Pick 3 random commands from Priority 1. Run each with:
```bash
<cli> <command> --help          # Does it show realistic examples?
<cli> <command> --dry-run       # Does it show the request without sending?
<cli> <command> --json          # Does it produce valid JSON?
```

If any of the 3 fail, there's a systemic issue. Fix it across all commands before proceeding. This catches problems like "--dry-run not wired" or "--json outputs table instead of JSON" early, when they're cheap to fix.

After passing the Priority 1 Review Gate, update the lock heartbeat:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase build-p1
```

Get Priority 0 and 1 working first (the foundation and absorbed features), pass the review gate, then build Priority 2 (transcendence), then verify.

Write:

`$PROOFS_DIR/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-build-log.md`

Include:
- what was built
- what was intentionally deferred
- skipped body fields that remain
- any generator limitations found

## Phase 4: Shipcheck

Run one combined verification block.

Before running shipcheck, update the lock heartbeat:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase shipcheck
```

```bash
printing-press dogfood         --dir "$CLI_WORK_DIR" --spec <same-spec>
printing-press verify          --dir "$CLI_WORK_DIR" --spec <same-spec> --fix
printing-press workflow-verify --dir "$CLI_WORK_DIR"
printing-press scorecard       --dir "$CLI_WORK_DIR" --spec <same-spec>
```

Interpretation:
- `dogfood` catches dead flags, dead helpers, invalid paths, example drift, broken data wiring, and command tree/config field wiring bugs
- `verify` catches runtime breakage and runs the auto-fix loop for common failures
- `workflow-verify` tests the primary workflow end-to-end using the verification manifest (workflow_verify.yaml). Three verdicts: workflow-pass, workflow-fail, unverified-needs-auth
- `scorecard` is the structural quality snapshot, not the source of truth by itself

Fix order (update heartbeat between each fix category to prevent stale lock during long fix loops):
1. generation blockers or build breaks
2. invalid paths and auth mismatches
3. dead flags / dead functions / ghost tables
4. broken dry-run and runtime command failures
5. scorecard-only polish gaps

After fixing each category, update the heartbeat:
```bash
printing-press lock update --cli <api>-pp-cli --phase shipcheck-fixing
```

<!-- CODEX_PHASE4_START -->
When `CODEX_MODE` is true, read [references/codex-delegation.md](references/codex-delegation.md)
for the Phase 4 fix delegation pattern.

When `CODEX_MODE` is false, fix bugs directly.
<!-- CODEX_PHASE4_END -->

Ship threshold:
- `verify` verdict is `PASS` or high `WARN` with 0 critical failures
- `dogfood` no longer fails because of spec parsing, binary path, or skipped examples
- `dogfood` wiring checks pass (no unregistered commands, no config field mismatches)
- `workflow-verify` verdict is `workflow-pass` or `unverified-needs-auth` (not `workflow-fail`)
- `scorecard` is at least 65, or meaningfully improved and no core behavior is broken

Maximum 2 shipcheck loops by default.

Write:

`$PROOFS_DIR/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-shipcheck.md`

Include:
- command outputs and scores
- top blockers found
- fixes applied
- before/after verify pass rate
- before/after scorecard total
- final ship recommendation: `ship`, `ship-with-gaps`, or `hold`

If the final verdict is `hold`, release the lock without promoting to library:
```bash
printing-press lock release --cli <api>-pp-cli
```
The working copy remains in `$CLI_WORK_DIR` for potential future retry. Proceed to Phase 5.5 to archive manuscripts (archiving still happens on hold).

## Phase 5: Dogfood Testing

**MANDATORY when an API key is available.** This is where you use the CLI as an
actual user would — not just "does it start" but "does it produce correct, useful
output for real workflows."

Shipcheck verified the CLI builds and commands respond. Dogfood verifies it
actually works.

Read and follow [references/dogfood-testing.md](references/dogfood-testing.md) for
the complete dogfood protocol: depth selection (quick check vs full lifecycle),
test plan execution, inline fix workflow, and reporting.

**Key rules:**
- Fix issues as you find them, not at the end. The value is discovering bugs in
  context.
- Note whether each fix is CLI-specific or a machine issue (feeds the retro).
- If a fix changes the sync, data layer, or output pipeline, re-run the relevant
  shipcheck tool (`verify` or `scorecard`) once after all dogfood fixes.

Write:

`$PROOFS_DIR/<stamp>-fix-<api>-pp-cli-dogfood.md`

## Phase 5.5: Promote and Archive

### Promote to Library

If the shipcheck verdict is `ship` or `ship-with-gaps`, promote the verified CLI from the working directory to the library. This must happen BEFORE archiving — the CLI in the library is the primary deliverable.

```bash
# Promote verified CLI to library (copies working dir, writes manifest, releases lock)
printing-press lock promote --cli <api>-pp-cli --dir "$CLI_WORK_DIR"
```

The `promote` command handles the full sequence: stages the working directory, atomically swaps it into `$PRESS_LIBRARY/<api>-pp-cli`, writes the `.printing-press.json` manifest, updates the `CurrentRunPointer`, and releases the lock — all in one step.

If the shipcheck verdict is `hold`, the lock was already released in Phase 4. Do NOT promote. The working copy stays in `$CLI_WORK_DIR` and is not copied to the library.

### Archive Manuscripts

Archive the run's research, proofs, and discovery artifacts to `$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/`
**unconditionally** after promotion (or after lock release for `hold` verdicts). This
happens regardless of the shipcheck verdict — even a `hold` run produces research
and proofs that future runs should be able to reuse.

Archiving and publishing are separate concerns. Archiving preserves research for
future `/printing-press` runs on the same API. Publishing ships the CLI to the
library repo. A run that isn't ready to publish still produces valuable research.

```bash
# Archive under CLI name (e.g., steam-web-pp-cli), not API slug (e.g., steam).
# The CLI name is unambiguous and matches what publish expects.
CLI_NAME="$(basename "$PRESS_LIBRARY/<api>-pp-cli")"
mkdir -p "$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/$CLI_NAME/$RUN_ID"
cp -r "$RESEARCH_DIR" "$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/$CLI_NAME/$RUN_ID/research" 2>/dev/null || true
cp -r "$PROOFS_DIR" "$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/$CLI_NAME/$RUN_ID/proofs" 2>/dev/null || true

# Archive discovery artifacts (sniff captures, URL lists, sniff report).
# Remove session state before archiving — contains authentication cookies/tokens.
rm -f "$DISCOVERY_DIR/session-state.json"

# Strip response bodies from HAR before archiving to control size.
if [ -d "$DISCOVERY_DIR" ]; then
  for har in "$DISCOVERY_DIR"/sniff-capture.har "$DISCOVERY_DIR"/sniff-capture.json; do
    if [ -f "$har" ] && command -v jq >/dev/null 2>&1; then
      jq 'del(.log.entries[].response.content.text)' "$har" > "${har}.stripped" 2>/dev/null && mv "${har}.stripped" "$har" || rm -f "${har}.stripped"
    fi
  done
  cp -r "$DISCOVERY_DIR" "$PRESS_MANUSCRIPTS/$CLI_NAME/$RUN_ID/discovery" 2>/dev/null || true
fi
```

**MANDATORY: After archiving, you MUST proceed to Phase 6 (Publish) below. Do not print a summary and stop. Do not treat archiving as the end of the run. The run ends when the user has been asked about publishing (or the verdict is `hold`).**

## Phase 6: Publish

**This phase is NOT optional.** Every run with a `ship` or `ship-with-gaps` verdict MUST reach this point. Do not skip it.

After archiving, offer to publish the CLI to the library repo.

### Gate

Use the most recent shipcheck verdict:
- if Phase 5 reran shipcheck after a live-smoke fix, use that rerun verdict
- otherwise use the Phase 4 verdict

Skip this phase entirely if the final shipcheck verdict is `hold`. Only proceed for `ship` or `ship-with-gaps`.

### Check for existing PR

Run a lightweight check for your own open publish PR. The `--author @me` filter avoids matching someone else's PR for the same CLI name.

```bash
gh pr list --repo mvanhorn/printing-press-library --head "feat/<cli-name>" --state open --author @me --json number,url --jq '.[0]' 2>/dev/null
```

If this fails (gh not authenticated, network error, etc.), continue without PR context — the publish skill will handle auth in its own Step 1.

### Offer

Present via `AskUserQuestion`:

**If an existing open PR was found:**

> "<cli-name> passed shipcheck. There's an open publish PR (#N). Want to update it with this version?"
>
> 1. **Yes — update PR #N** (re-validate, re-package, and push to the existing PR)
> 2. **No — I'm done**

**If no existing PR:**

> "<cli-name> passed shipcheck ([score]/100, verify [pass-rate]%). What do you want to do?"
>
> 1. **Publish now** (validate, package, and open a PR)
> 2. **Polish first** (run `/printing-press-polish` to fix verify failures, dead code, and README before publishing)
> 3. **Run retro** (analyze the session to find improvements for the generator)
> 4. **Done for now**

If the verdict was `ship-with-gaps`, prepend: "Note: shipcheck found minor gaps (see the shipcheck report above)." and recommend the polish option.

### If "Publish now"

Invoke `/printing-press publish <cli-name>`. The publish skill handles everything from there.

### If "Polish first"

Invoke `/printing-press-polish <cli-name>`. The polish skill runs diagnostics, fixes issues, reports the delta, and offers its own publish at the end.

### If "Run retro"

Invoke `/printing-press-retro`. The retro skill analyzes the session for generator improvements.

### If "Done for now"

End normally. The CLI is in `$PRESS_LIBRARY/<api>-pp-cli` and the user can run `/printing-press publish` or `/printing-press-polish` later.

## Fast Guidance

### When to use `printing-press print`

Use `printing-press print <api>` only when the user explicitly wants a resumable on-disk pipeline with phase seeds. It is optional.

The fast path for `/printing-press <API>` is:
- brief
- generate
- build
- shipcheck

### When to stop researching

Stop when you can answer:
- what to build first
- what data to persist
- what incumbent features cannot be missing

If the next research step does not change those answers, stop and generate.

### What not to do

Do not:
- write 5 separate mandatory research documents
- defer all workflows to "future work"
- skip verification because the CLI compiles
- treat scorecard alone as ship proof
- discover YAML/URL spec incompatibility late and manually convert specs if the tools can already consume them
- rerun the whole late-phase gauntlet for cosmetic README polish
- skip features because "the MCP already handles that" (absorb everything, beat it with offline + agent-native)
- build only "top 3-5 workflows" when the absorb manifest has 15+ (build them ALL, then transcend)
- generate before the Phase 1.5 Ecosystem Absorb Gate is approved
- call a CLI "GOAT" without matching every feature the best competitor has

### What counts as success

Success is:
- a generated CLI that gets to shipcheck without generator blockers
- verification tools working against the same spec the user generated from
- one or two fix loops, not a maze of re-entry phases
- a CLI that is plausibly shippable today, not a perfect design memo
