# CLI Printing Press - Development Conventions

## Build, Test & Lint

```bash
go build -o ./printing-press ./cmd/printing-press
go test ./...
gofmt -w ./...
golangci-lint run ./...
```

A pre-commit hook runs `gofmt -w` on staged Go files automatically. A pre-push hook runs `golangci-lint`. The same config (`.golangci.yml`: errcheck, govet, staticcheck, unused) runs in CI. To run lint manually: `golangci-lint run ./...`

**Always run `gofmt -w ./...` after writing Go code.** Subagents and code generators often produce valid but unformatted Go. The pre-commit hook catches this for commits in the repo, but code written to external directories (e.g., `~/printing-press/library/`) must be formatted explicitly.

**IMPORTANT: Always use relative paths for build output.** Never build to `/tmp` or any shared absolute path. Multiple worktrees run concurrently and will stomp on each other. Use `./printing-press` exactly as shown above.

## Project Structure

- `cmd/printing-press/` - CLI entry point
- `internal/spec/` - Internal YAML spec parser
- `internal/openapi/` - OpenAPI 3.0+ parser
- `internal/generator/` - Template engine + quality gates
- `internal/catalog/` - Catalog schema validator
- `catalog/` - API catalog entries (YAML) + Go embed package (`catalog.FS`). Adding a YAML file here requires rebuilding the binary
- `skills/` - Claude Code skill definitions
- `testdata/` - Test fixtures (internal + OpenAPI specs)

## Glossary

Key terms used throughout this repo. Several have overloaded meanings — the glossary establishes canonical names to use in conversation and code comments.

**Use the canonical term** (left column) in your own responses so intent stays unambiguous. If the user's phrasing is ambiguous and the distinction affects what action to take — e.g., "publish it" could mean the pipeline step or pushing to the public library repo — ask before acting.

| Canonical term | Meaning |
|----------------|---------|
| **the printing press** / **the machine** | This repo's generator system — the Go binary, templates, skills, and catalog that together produce CLIs. |
| **printed CLI** / **`<api>-pp-cli`** | A CLI produced by the printing press (e.g., `notion-pp-cli`). The `-pp-` infix avoids collisions with official vendor CLIs. When someone says "the CLI" without qualification, they almost always mean a printed CLI. Use "printed CLI" in your responses to keep it clear. |
| **the printing-press binary** | The Go binary built from `cmd/printing-press/`. Commands: `generate`, `verify`, `emboss`, `scorecard`, `publish`, etc. Always say "printing-press binary" or "generator binary" — never just "the CLI" — when referring to this. |
| **spec** | The API contract that drives generation — OpenAPI 3.0+ YAML/JSON, GraphQL SDL, or internal YAML format. Can come from catalog, URL, local file, or sniff discovery. |
| **API slug** | Normalized API name derived from the spec title via `cleanSpecName()`. Directory key in manuscripts (`manuscripts/<api-slug>/`). The CLI name is `<api-slug>-pp-cli`. Distinct from the CLI name — don't use them interchangeably. |
| **brief** | The output of the machine's research phase (Phase 1) — a condensed doc covering API identity, competitors, data layer, and product thesis. Stored in `manuscripts/<api>/<run>/research/`. Drives all downstream decisions. |
| **crowd sniff** / **sniff** | Discovery technique that scrapes npm, PyPI, and GitHub for unofficial API clients to learn undocumented endpoints, auth patterns, and rate limits. Produces a `discovery/` manuscript with sniff-report.md, HAR captures, and unique-paths.txt. Used when no official spec exists or to supplement one. |
| **manuscript** | The full archive of a generation run. Contains three subdirectories: `research/` (briefs, spec analysis), `proofs/` (dogfood, verify, scorecard results), and optionally `discovery/` (sniff artifacts). Stored at `~/printing-press/manuscripts/<api-slug>/<run-id>/`. |
| **emboss** | A second-pass improvement cycle for an already-printed CLI. Audits baseline, re-researches, identifies top improvements, rebuilds, re-verifies, reports delta. Subcommand: `printing-press emboss <api>`. Still active — not deprecated. |
| **polish** | Targeted fix-up of a printed CLI (distinct from emboss's full cycle). Skill: `/printing-press-polish`. The retro improves the machine; polish improves the printed CLI. |
| **retro** / **retrospective** | Post-generation analysis of *the machine itself* — not the printed CLI. Identifies systemic improvements to templates, the Go binary, skill instructions, or catalog. Output goes to `docs/retros/` and `manuscripts/<api>/<run>/proofs/`. |
| **quality gates** | 7 mechanical static checks every printed CLI must pass: go mod tidy, go vet, go build, binary build, `--help`, version, doctor. These are build-time checks — see **verify** for runtime testing. |
| **verify** | Runtime behavioral testing of a printed CLI — runs every command against the real API (read-only) or a mock server. Produces PASS/WARN/FAIL verdicts. Has `--fix` mode for auto-patching. Distinct from quality gates (static) and dogfood (structural). |
| **dogfood** | Generation-time structural validation of a printed CLI against its source spec. Catches dead flags, invalid API paths, auth mismatches. Subcommand: `printing-press dogfood`. Compare with **doctor** (shipped in the CLI for end-users) and **verify** (runtime behavioral). |
| **shipcheck** | The three-part verification block that gates publishing: dogfood + verify + scorecard, run together. All three must pass before a printed CLI ships. |
| **scorecard** / **scoring** | Two-tier quality assessment. Tier 1: infrastructure (12 dimensions, 60 pts). Tier 2: domain correctness (6 dimensions, 40 pts). Total /100 with letter grades. Subcommand: `printing-press scorecard`. |
| **doctor** | Self-diagnostic command shipped inside every printed CLI for end-users to run. Checks environment, auth config, and connectivity at the user's runtime. Unlike dogfood (which validates at generation time), doctor runs post-install. |
| **local library** | `~/printing-press/library/<cli-name>/` — where printed CLIs land after a successful run. Local directory, not a git repo. |
| **public library repo** | The GitHub repo [`mvanhorn/printing-press-library`](https://github.com/mvanhorn/printing-press-library) — public catalog of finished CLIs organized by category. `/printing-press-publish` pushes here. |
| **publish (pipeline)** | The pipeline step that moves a working CLI into the local library and writes the `.printing-press.json` provenance manifest. |
| **publish (to public library repo)** | The skill-driven workflow (`/printing-press-publish`) that packages a local library CLI and creates a PR in the public library repo. |
| **provenance** / **`.printing-press.json`** | Manifest written to each published CLI's root. Contains generation metadata: spec URL, checksum, run ID, printing-press version, timestamp. Makes the directory self-describing. |
| **catalog** | Embedded YAML entries in `catalog/` describing available APIs (name, spec URL, category, tier). Baked into the binary at build time via `catalog.FS`. |
| **tier** | Catalog classification: `official` (vendor-maintained spec) or `community` (unofficial/reverse-engineered). Affects risk expectations. |
| **runstate** | Mutable per-workspace state at `~/printing-press/.runstate/<scope>/`. Tracks current run and sync cursors. Distinct from manuscripts, which are immutable archives. |

## Commit Style

**Format:** `type(scope): description` — scope is always required.

**Scopes** (these appear in changelogs and release notes):

| Scope | Covers | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| `cli` | Go binary, commands, flags, embedded catalog, docs | `feat(cli): add catalog subcommands` |
| `skills` | Skill definitions (SKILL.md), references, setup contract | `fix(skills): remove repo checkout requirement` |
| `ci` | Workflows, release config, goreleaser | `feat(ci): add release-please` |

Every commit and PR title must include one of these scopes. The `PR Title` action enforces this.

**Breaking changes** use `!` after the scope: `feat(cli)!: rename catalog command to registry`. This triggers a major version bump.

**Version bump rules** (release-please reads these from commit prefixes):
- `fix(scope):` → patch (0.4.0 → 0.4.1)
- `feat(scope):` → minor (0.4.0 → 0.5.0)
- `feat(scope)!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer → major (0.4.0 → 1.0.0)
- `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:` → included in next release but don't trigger a bump alone

**PR titles must follow the same format.** GitHub's "Squash and merge" uses the PR title as the squash commit message, so release-please reads PR titles on main. The `PR Title` GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/pr-title.yml`) enforces this — PRs with invalid titles cannot merge.

## Versioning

**Never manually edit version numbers.** Three files carry the version and release-please keeps them in sync:
- `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` → `version`
- `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` → `plugins[0].version`
- `internal/version/version.go` → `var Version` (annotated with `x-release-please-version`)

`TestVersionConsistencyAcrossFiles` in `internal/cli/release_test.go` will fail if versions drift.

## Release Process

Releases are fully automated. No manual steps required.

1. **Merge PRs to main** with conventional commit messages / PR titles
2. **release-please opens a release PR** accumulating all changes since the last release, with a generated changelog
3. **Merge the release PR** when ready to cut a release
4. **Automated:** release-please bumps all three version files, creates a git tag, and creates a GitHub release
5. **Automated:** goreleaser builds cross-platform binaries (linux/darwin/windows × amd64/arm64) and attaches them to the release
6. **Users update** via `go install ...@latest` (picks up the new tag) or download binaries from the release

## Adding Catalog Entries

Catalog entries in `catalog/` must pass `internal/catalog` validation:
- Required fields: name, display_name, description, category, spec_url, spec_format, tier
- spec_url must use HTTPS
- category must be: developer-tools, monitoring, cloud, project-management, productivity, social-and-messaging, sales-and-crm, marketing, payments, auth, commerce, ai, media-and-entertainment, devices, other
- tier must be: official or community

## Testing

**When you change code, check for a `_test.go` file in the same package.** If one exists, read it — your change likely requires a test update. If tests fail after your change, investigate whether it's a bug in your code or a stale test — don't just delete.

Add tests for new non-trivial logic. Match the package's existing style (typically table-driven with `testify/assert`). Skip tests for CLI glue, trivial wrappers, and code only meaningfully tested via integration (`FULL_RUN=1`).

Run `go test ./...` before considering your work done.

## Quality Gates

Generated CLIs must pass 7 gates: go mod tidy, go vet, go build, binary build, --help, version, doctor.

## `~/printing-press/` Layout

Generated artifacts live under the user's home directory, not in this repo.

- `library/<cli-name>/` — Published CLIs (e.g., `notion-pp-cli`). Directory name matches the derived CLI name from `naming.CLI()`.
- `manuscripts/<api-slug>/` — Archived research and verification proofs, keyed by API slug (e.g., `notion`), not CLI name. One API can have multiple runs.
- `.runstate/<scope>/` — Mutable per-workspace state (current run, sync cursors). Scoped by repo basename + hash.

The API slug is derived by the generator from the spec title (`cleanSpecName`), not manually chosen. The CLI name is `<api-slug>-pp-cli`. Never hardcode an API slug when the generator can derive it — names with periods (cal.com, dub.co) normalize differently than you'd guess.

The `-pp-` infix exists to avoid colliding with official CLIs. `notion-pp-cli` can coexist with whatever `notion-cli` Notion ships themselves.

## Internal Skills

`.claude/skills/` contains internal skills for developing the printing press itself (e.g., `printing-press-retro`). These load automatically when Claude Code is started from inside this repo — no setup needed.

If you're running Claude Code from a different directory and need these skills available, install them globally:

```bash
.claude/scripts/install-internal-skills.sh
```

This copies the internal skills to `~/.claude/skills/`.

## Skill Authoring: Reference File Pattern

Skills use a `references/` directory for content that is only needed during specific phases or conditions. The SKILL.md stays lean with inline pointers (`Read [references/foo.md](...) when X`), and the agent loads the reference file only when the condition is met.

**Why this matters:** SKILL.md content is loaded into the context window for every tool call in the session. A 2,000-line skill burns tokens on every phase — even phases that don't need most of the content. Extracting conditional sections (e.g., browser capture flows only needed when sniffing, codex templates only needed in codex mode) into reference files reduces baseline context by 30-40%.

**What stays inline:** Cardinal rules, decision matrices, phase structure, user-facing prompts — anything the agent needs at all times or to decide whether to load more.

**What gets extracted:** Implementation details for conditional paths: capture tool CLI commands, delegation templates, scoring frameworks, report templates. These are loaded on-demand when the agent reaches the relevant phase gate.
